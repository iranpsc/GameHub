## Issues Found and Recommendations

1) Backend PHP/Composer missing in CI environment; cannot run migrations/tests
   - Fix: Install php8.2-cli, composer, and enable Xdebug; rerun backend tests.
2) Missing backend .env.example in repo
   - Fix: Commit a proper backend/.env.example and reference it in README testing steps (.env.test).
3) Frontend build failed initially due to missing @tailwindcss/postcss
   - Fix: Add @tailwindcss/postcss to devDependencies and commit lockfile.
4) Login Page UI does not match provided design (no server clock, ping, internet speed widgets)
   - Fix: Implement the specified widgets and styling; add jest/dom tests and screenshot tests.
5) Offline Kiosk behavior not implemented/tested
   - Fix: Add offline strategy (Service Worker/app cache) or document behavior; add e2e test.
6) Integration smoke test not executed due to missing PHP runtime
   - Fix: After installing PHP/composer, run full integration steps.
